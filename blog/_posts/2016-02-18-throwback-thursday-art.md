<img src="/img/18022016/tom.jpg" alt="a pencil portrait of Tom Riddle" align="left" style="PADDING-RIGHT: 15px"/> For Throwback Thursday this week I will be sharing an old illustration of mine I am still quite happy with.

This dates back to 2010, and it was done with pencils on simple A4 paper, then enhanced with a computer to add a background texture and some colour.

It is a portrait of Tom Riddle, and it is my version of the character (based on how I imagined him when I read the books), even though I somewhat borrowed the clothing- and hair- style from movieverse Riddle.

He is not very amused.
