Here is my progress with the blog for this week.
I consider it mostly done now from an appearence point of view, and I realise this kind of updates can be a little boring, therefore I will now write a "blog update" post only with major updates.

So, here is my updated _to do_ list for this blog:

* <s>Make it more colorful</s>. Change the colour of the big title and of post titles. Change all other colours to match one specific colour scheme.
* <s>Change the avatar</s>. That icon over there is cool, but I'd like something more personal. that goes well with the colour scheme.
* Image previews. I'd like my list of posts to show preview images if available, and icons based on the post type. This is mostly because I plan to post some of my drawings in here, and it'd be nice if they could be seen from the preview in the main page.
* Tags, categories, and other blog elements. This is what makes dynamic blogs nice, and I know Jekyll can do it (I just need to learn how...)
* Add <s>a page for links</s>, and a page for projects.

I have looked into tags and categories. but they look rather tricky to implement. I will have to look into it more before I can implement this functionality.
Haven't started researching image previews yet.
